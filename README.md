This project represents a personalized website developed using a mastery of HTML and CSS skills. The website serves as a dynamic book store, elegantly presenting an extensive selection of books alongside their respective authors. To enhance user experience and knowledge enrichment, clickable links were thoughtfully integrated for each book title, facilitating seamless navigation to dedicated Wikipedia pages. In addition, the website features a sidebar with links to various genres such as horror, thriller, environmental drama, and more, each leading to separate pages where specific genres of books are available.The website's navigation bar provides easy access to the home page, contents, about section, and contact page, ensuring smooth navigation for users. At the end of the website, two essential forms are incorporated to facilitate interaction. The contact form gathers information about the user, enabling them to get in touch, while the book submission form collects details about books viewers would like to contribute. This project exemplifies a commitment to user-centric web solutions, contributing to an overall improved browsing experience for visitors.
